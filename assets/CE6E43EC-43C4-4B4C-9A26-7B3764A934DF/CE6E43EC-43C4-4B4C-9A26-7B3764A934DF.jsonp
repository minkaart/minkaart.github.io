Extending this idea into various understandings of ‘the virtual’ and ‘the real,’ “the virtual stabbing at the fabric of the real | the real stabbing at the fabric of the virtual” looks to our presentation of self in online space. By using imagery from both the radical and the mundane, and actually allowing these images to visually disrupt each other, the work attempts to blur distinctions between these realms and to challenge the perceived radical-ness of either. By revealing that these individuals are only ‘exceptional’ within the context of the unexpected event or action, the work seeks to become kind of protest on behalf of radical actors, one in which the shared experience should overshadow the exceptional.   ","targetRectangle":{"y":331.54953122138977,"x":21.113319396972656,"width":468.84385675668722,"height":140}},{"text":"Each image in this series is created  using a self-authored program in the C programming language that exchanges binary image data between images.
